#Introduction
Speedwork provides a powerful filesystem abstraction thanks to the wonderful Flysystem PHP package by Frank de Jonge. 
The Speedwork Flysystem integration provides simple to use drivers for working with local filesystems, Amazon S3, and Rackspace Cloud Storage. 
Even better, it's amazingly simple to switch between these storage options as the API remains the same for each system.
